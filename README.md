# Game of Life

This is my attempt to coding [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It is also a bit of an excuse to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Requirements

To run the program you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), mostly because my linter didn't really like NPM

## Install

Open a terminal and type `yarn` to install all the dependencies

## Run

You can run the program by using the command:

```
yarn watch
```

Or build it using:

```
yarn build-dev
```
